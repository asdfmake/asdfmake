## 💡 About Me

I have strong back-end development skills, with deep knowledge of **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, and frameworks like **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Next.js**. I'm also highly experienced with **Spring Boot**, using **Java** and **Kotlin** to create scalable and robust APIs and back-end services. I’ve worked with relational and non-relational databases such as **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, and **Redis**, and I enjoy designing clean, efficient server-side architectures.

In addition to development, I have hands-on **DevOps experience**, both from personal and professional projects. I’m proficient in deploying and maintaining applications using **Linux**, **Bash scripting**, and tools like **Docker**, **Docker Compose**, **Apache**, and **Nginx**. I'm comfortable configuring web servers, managing virtual machines, and setting up automated, reliable deployment pipelines on cloud-based or self-hosted infrastructure.
